# UNDERSTANDING THE .NET PLATFORM

## EXPLORATION Q/A

- The topics under the exploration questions are explored and the answers are included in a separate markdown file.

## PRACTICAL EXCERCISE

- A Console application is developed to perform basic math functions.
- A class called `MathUtils` was implemented with the following methods:
  - `Add` : Takes two integer parameters and returns their sum.
  - `Subtract` : Takes two integer parameters and returns their difference.
  - `Multiply` : Takes two integer parameters and returns their product.
  - `Divide` : Takes two integer parameters and returns their quotient. 
- The user is prompted to enter two integers and the methods from the MathUtils class are called to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
- The results are then displayed to the user.

## CHALLENGES
- Some questions from the exploration part required researching multiple resources to get a clear understanding of the concept and to provide a proper answer.
